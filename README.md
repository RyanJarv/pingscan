# pingscan

This was just a fun side project to kill some
boredom. My goal was to implement it entirely
from the RFC, which I mostly succeeded in doing.

This was a while ago now, but if I remember
correctly the only exception to this was the bytes
for something in the RFC appeared to be backwards
the best I could tell. I believe I sorted that out
by just messing with random stuff until it worked.

Not exactly professional, I know but neither was
this project, so whatever. It still works.. I think.
